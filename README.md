# tic-tac-toe
A tic-tac-toe game built with HTML/CSS/Javascript. Includes the option to play against another player or the computer. 

The computer AI has two options, an "Easy" mode that chooses a random spot, and the "Hard" mode, which uses a recursive algorithim to play the best move possible for every turn. Good luck!
